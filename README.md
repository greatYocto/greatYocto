This book was written with the intention that others wouldn't have to go through the trial and error that the i experienced while studying after encountering a new domain for the first time.
It started with curiosity, but as i began writing, it proved to be more challenging than anticipated. 
Writing late into the night at study cafes after work, there were moments of questioning, 'Why am I putting myself through this?', 'How will readers perceive this content?' and various other concerns.
However, just as nothing is achieved in life without effort, looking back, the time spent writing was a profoundly joyful experience for the author. 
Upon closer inspection, even the content that was thought to be well understood revealed areas for improvement, and exploring concepts that were previously overlooked took up a significant amount of time.
Yet, while reading related books and studying a lot of internet resources, valuable moments were spent learning more. 
With the goal of creating a book suitable for practitioners working in the field, unnecessary grammar and tool usage were boldly omitted, and instead, practical functionalities were presented with examples and detailed explanations.
<br/><br/>

In a book by a popular YouTuber titled "Life is a Practical Experience," there is a passage that goes like this: 
<br/>
"Don't worry about getting older, and don't worry about starting too late. Instead, worry about not doing things properly. There is no such thing as a 'too late' in the world. There are only 'completed' and 'incomplete' in the world."
